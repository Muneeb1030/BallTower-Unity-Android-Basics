# Unity Ball Spring Game
## Introduction
Welcome to the Unity Ball Spring Game project! This project is a simple game demonstrating physics interactions where a ball attached to a spring hits cubes to knock them down. It's a great example of using Unity's physics engine and touch input features for Android devices.

## Features
- **Physics Simulation** Experience realistic physics interactions with a ball attached to a spring.
- **Touch Controls:** Utilize single and multi-touch gestures to interact with the game.
- **Object Interaction:** Knock down cubes by releasing the spring-loaded ball.
- **Simple Gameplay:** Pull back the ball using sliding gestures and release to launch.
## Things Learnt
In this project, you'll learn:

- How to implement physics-based interactions using Unity's Rigidbody and SpringJoint components.
- Handling touch input for Android devices, including single and multi-touch gestures.
- Basic game mechanics like launching objects and triggering interactions based on physics collisions.
## Contribution
Contributions to this project are welcome! Here are some ways you can contribute:

- **Bug Fixes:** Report any issues or bugs you encounter, or directly fix them in the code.
- **Enhancements:** Add new features, improve gameplay mechanics, or optimize performance.
